        <p class="intro">
	  The 2nd edition of <a href="http://www.joyofclojure.com">The Joy of Clojure</a>
	  is underway.  Thanks to everyone who bought and provided positive reviews of the 
	  1st edition we have a chance to expand our coverage of Clojure and the
	  Clojure way.  <a href="http://twitter.com/joyofclojure">Follow @joyofclojure
	  on Twitter</a> for book updates and discount codes.
	</p>

        <p class="intro">
	  Below are just a few of the changes that we have planned for the 2nd edition.

          <h2>ClojureScript</h2>
	  <p>
	    With the release of ClojureScript, the Clojure language has spread its
	    velvety tentacles into the browser.  We'll cover the use of ClojureScript
	    and also the properties that make it the best of the JavaScript.next
	    languages.

        <section class="col mid">
          <h2>Thinking code</h2>
          <p>
	    Expanding on our coverage of functional programming techniques, we plan
	    to cover a wide range of "thinking" techniques.  This includes: unification,
	    logic programming, constraint solving, declarative programming, and more.

        <section class="col">
          <h2>Data-orientation</h2>
          <p>
	    Clojure is a language geared and adept at data processing tasks.  We expand
	    our coverage in this realm and dive deeply into viewing applications (and
	    even code itself) through a data-centric lens.
