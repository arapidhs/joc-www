Many things were cut from *The Joy of Clojure* and may resurface should a second edition ever materialize. Potential topics that may one day make it into the book include:

- [ClojureScript](http://www.github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
- Tagged literals
- Logic programming and unification
- `defrecord` literals
- The reader
- Expanded discussion of the lack of design patterns
- Expanded discussion of parallelism
- Alternative Clojure implementations
- Typed Clojure
- Short-circuiting `reduce`
- Expanded discussion of `clojure.zip`

... and other topics, yet to be discovered. Lobby for another edition from [Manning Publishing](http://manning.com) if you would like to see these and other awesome topics.
