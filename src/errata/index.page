Maybe this book is perfect? Apparently not *quite*. We'll continue to post errata as it arrives.

### Chapter 1
- Page 17: should be `(joy.chess/lookup (`**`joy.chess/`**`initial-board) "a1")`

### Chapter 2
- Page 40: should be "`report-ns` exists in the **`joy.ch2`** namespace"

### Chapter 3
- Page 51, Section 3.4: should be "from one to **the** other"
- Page 52: Regular expressions are covered in **section 4.5, page 73**

### Chapter 4
- Page 71, Section 4.4: should be "when evaluated in the `(identical? x` **`y`**`)` form"

### Chapter 5
- Page 85, Listing 5.1: The last line of the listing should be:
- `(map #`**`(vec`** `(map + yx %)`**`)`** ` deltas))))`
  
### Chapter 7
- Page 153: note the errata from page 85 above
- Section 7.4: The A* `h` function uses a very high weighted value to estimate path cost.  As a result, the examples presented provide estimations that are too pessimistic.

### Chapter 8
- Page 160: quoting was introduced in **section 2.6, page 32**
- Page 163: quoting was introduced in **section 2.6, page 32**

### Chapter 9
- Page 192: should be **`(TreeNode. 5 nil nil)`** *(not* `(TreeNodePlus 5 nil nil)`*)*

### Chapter 10
- Page 217: the word `genclass` should be removed from the `"Eat Cheetos"` example.

### Resources
- Page 317: should be "**Norvig,** Peter 1998."
